# **EU Energy P2P  Tunnel**

## How to get this item?

You can now find it in the Creative Tab of AE2.

In survival mode, you can use the GTCEU terminal to right-click on any tunnel for attunement.

You can use it like other P2P networks, it can be connected to GTCEU cables and transmit energy. Its feature is that the voltage of each output port is the same, and the current will be divided equally among the input ports according to the number of output ports.

Unlike FE P2P Tunnel,AE system will not extract 5% of your power, so you can use it for long-distance power transmission without worrying about voltage loss.

## About configuration!

It has two modes of dividing the current equally:

The first type : It works when the size of the current is exactly divisible by the number of output ports.

<u>For example, if I input a current of 8 amperes, the system will only work when the number of output ports is 1, 2, 4, or 8.</u>

The second type : The current will be evenly distributed to each output port directly.

You can change its mode in the configuration file, and the default mode is the first one.
